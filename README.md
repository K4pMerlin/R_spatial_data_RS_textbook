:book: This tutorial is based on Dr. Lubinbin's book "A Practical Tutorial on Spatial Data Processing and Analysis in R".

:fireworks: This tutorial is based on Dr. Lu Binbin's R language spatial data processing and analysis of practice tutorial book, due to the spatial data processing in the `sp`, `maptools` and other packages are about to be retired or have been retired, so we are in the book of spatial data processing section of the book was rewritten based on the `sf` package in the R language.
And we have changed the basic data processing to the more popular processing based on the `tidyverse` package.
